While theoretical properties of PDMPs have been studied extensively, their practical implementation remains limited to specific applications in which bounds on the gradient of the negative log-target can be derived. In order to address this problem, we propose to approximate PDMPs using splitting schemes, that means simulating the deterministic dynamics and the random jumps in two different stages. We show that symmetric splittings of PDMPs are of second order. Then we focus on the Zig-Zag sampler (ZZS) and show how to remove the bias of the splitting scheme with a skew reversible Metropolis filter. Finally, we illustrate with numerical simulations the advantages of our proposed scheme over competitors.\n\n\nBayesian score calibration for approximate models\nJoshua Bon Ceremade, Université Paris Dauphine-PSL\nScientists continue to develop increasingly complex mechanistic models to reflect their knowledge more realistically. Statistical inference using these models can be challenging since the corresponding likelihood function is often intractable and model simulation may be computationally burdensome.  Fortunately, in many of these situations, it is possible to adopt a surrogate model or approximate likelihood function.  It may be convenient to base Bayesian inference directly on the surrogate, but this can result in bias and poor uncertainty quantification.  In this paper we propose a new method for adjusting approximate posterior samples to reduce bias and produce more accurate uncertainty quantification.  We do this by optimizing a transform of the approximate posterior that maximizes a scoring rule.  Our approach requires only a (fixed) small number of complex model simulations and is numerically stable.  We demonstrate good performance of the new method on several examples of increasing complexity."

A recent line of research exploits Bayesian inference with informative priors to handle the ill-posedness of such problems. Amongst such priors, score-based generative models (SGM) have recently been successfully applied to several different inverse problems. In this study, we exploit the particular structure of the prior defined by the SGM to define a sequence of intermediate linear inverse problems. As the noise level decreases, the posteriors of these inverse problems get closer to the target posterior of the original inverse problem. To sample from this sequence of posteriors, we propose the use of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The proposed algorithm, MCGDiff, is shown to be theoretically grounded and we provide numerical simulations showing that it outperforms competing baselines when dealing with ill-posed inverse problems in a Bayesian setting.\n\n\nGenerative Flow Networks as Entropy-Regularized RL\nDaniil Tiapkin CMAP, École Polytechnique\nThe recently proposed generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are a method of training a policy to sample compositional discrete objects with probabilities proportional to a given reward via a sequence of actions. GFlowNets exploit the sequential nature of the problem, drawing parallels with reinforcement learning (RL). Our work extends the connection between RL and GFlowNets to a general case. We demonstrate how the task of learning a generative flow network can be efficiently redefined as an entropy-regularized RL problem with a specific reward and regularizer structure. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical efficiency of this reformulation by applying standard soft RL algorithms to GFlowNet training across several probabilistic modeling tasks. Contrary to previously reported results, we show that entropic RL approaches can be competitive against established GFlowNet training methods. This perspective opens a direct path for integrating reinforcement learning principles into the realm of generative flow networks."

Furthermore, Bayesian inference often comes in at a second moment, for example after running an optimization algorithm to find a MAP estimate. To tackle both these issues, we introduce Sparse Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (SVBMC), a method for fast “post-processes” Bayesian inference for models with black-box and noisy likelihoods. SVBMC reuses all existing target density evaluations – for example, from previous optimizations or partial Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs – to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of the log posterior density. Uncertain regions of the surrogate are then refined via active learning as needed. Our work builds on the Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) framework for sample-efficient inference, with several novel contributions. First, we make VBMC scalable to a large number of pre-existing evaluations via sparse GP regression, deriving novel Bayesian quadrature formulae and acquisition functions for active learning with sparse GPs. Second, we introduce noise shaping, a general technique to induce the sparse GP approximation to focus on high posterior density regions. Third, we prove theoretical results in support of the SVBMC refinement procedure. We validate our method on a variety of challenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications. We find that SVBMC consistently builds good posterior approximations by post-processing of existing model evaluations from different sources, often requiring only a small number of additional density evaluations.\n\n\nVariance reduction using control variates and importance sampling for applications in computational statistical physics\nUrbain Vaes INRIA, CERMICS\nThe scaling of the mobility coefficient associated with two-dimensional Langevin dynamics in a periodic potential as the friction vanishes is not well understood. Theoretical results are lacking, and numerical calculation of the mobility in the underdamped regime is challenging. In the first part of this talk, I will present a new variance reduction approach based on control variates for efficiently estimating the mobility of Langevin-type dynamics, together with numerical experiments illustrating the performance of the approach.\nIn the second part of this talk, we study an importance sampling approach for calculating averages with respect to multimodal probability distributions. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to this end, which are based on time averages along a realization of a Markov process ergodic with respect to the target probability distribution, are usually plagued by a large variance due to the metastability of the process. The estimator we study is based on an ergodic average along a realization of an overdamped Langevin process for a modified potential. We obtain an explicit expression for the optimal biasing potential in dimension 1 and propose a general numerical approach for approximating the optimal potential in the multi-dimensional setting."
