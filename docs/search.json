A recent line of research exploits Bayesian inference with informative priors to handle the ill-posedness of such problems. Amongst such priors, score-based generative models (SGM) have recently been successfully applied to several different inverse problems. In this study, we exploit the particular structure of the prior defined by the SGM to define a sequence of intermediate linear inverse problems. As the noise level decreases, the posteriors of these inverse problems get closer to the target posterior of the original inverse problem. To sample from this sequence of posteriors, we propose the use of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The proposed algorithm, MCGDiff, is shown to be theoretically grounded and we provide numerical simulations showing that it outperforms competing baselines when dealing with ill-posed inverse problems in a Bayesian setting.\n\n\nGenerative Flow Networks as Entropy-Regularized RL\nDaniil Tiapkin CMAP, École Polytechnique\nThe recently proposed generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are a method of training a policy to sample compositional discrete objects with probabilities proportional to a given reward via a sequence of actions. GFlowNets exploit the sequential nature of the problem, drawing parallels with reinforcement learning (RL). Our work extends the connection between RL and GFlowNets to a general case. We demonstrate how the task of learning a generative flow network can be efficiently redefined as an entropy-regularized RL problem with a specific reward and regularizer structure. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical efficiency of this reformulation by applying standard soft RL algorithms to GFlowNet training across several probabilistic modeling tasks. Contrary to previously reported results, we show that entropic RL approaches can be competitive against established GFlowNet training methods. This perspective opens a direct path for integrating reinforcement learning principles into the realm of generative flow networks."

While theoretical properties of PDMPs have been studied extensively, their practical implementation remains limited to specific applications in which bounds on the gradient of the negative log-target can be derived. In order to address this problem, we propose to approximate PDMPs using splitting schemes, that means simulating the deterministic dynamics and the random jumps in two different stages. We show that symmetric splittings of PDMPs are of second order. Then we focus on the Zig-Zag sampler (ZZS) and show how to remove the bias of the splitting scheme with a skew reversible Metropolis filter. Finally, we illustrate with numerical simulations the advantages of our proposed scheme over competitors.\n\n\nBayesian score calibration for approximate models\nJoshua Bon Ceremade, Université Paris Dauphine-PSL\nScientists continue to develop increasingly complex mechanistic models to reflect their knowledge more realistically. Statistical inference using these models can be challenging since the corresponding likelihood function is often intractable and model simulation may be computationally burdensome.  Fortunately, in many of these situations, it is possible to adopt a surrogate model or approximate likelihood function.  It may be convenient to base Bayesian inference directly on the surrogate, but this can result in bias and poor uncertainty quantification.  In this paper we propose a new method for adjusting approximate posterior samples to reduce bias and produce more accurate uncertainty quantification.  We do this by optimizing a transform of the approximate posterior that maximizes a scoring rule.  Our approach requires only a (fixed) small number of complex model simulations and is numerically stable.  We demonstrate good performance of the new method on several examples of increasing complexity."
