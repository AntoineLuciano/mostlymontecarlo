### Rejection sampling with quantum tricks: sampling determinantal point processes on a quantum computer

**Rémi Bardenet** *CNRS and CRIStAL, Université de Lille*

Joint work with Michaël Fanuel and Alexandre Feller.

Be it feature selection in regression or minibatch sampling in stochastic gradient descent, many data science applications can be formulated as selecting a small representative subset of a larger ground set of N items. Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are probability distributions originating in quantum optics, which allow selecting such representative subsets at a reasonable computational cost, and sometimes yield better-than-iid statistical guarantees. I will show that, given access to a quantum computer with as many qubits as the cardinality N of the ground set (an unrealistic assumption in 2025), one can sample a large class of determinantal point processes faster than on a classical computer. For Monte Carlo aficionados, I will show neat peculiarities of the quantum framework that allow us to replace a costly matrix decomposition by a cheap rejection sampling routine. The talk is based on Reference [2]. I will try to stick to a level of exposition that does not require any prior affinity with quantum computing, but if you have time prior to the talk, you can read Section 3 of [1] for a 3-page introduction to some of the notions I'll use.
