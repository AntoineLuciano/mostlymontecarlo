### Non-reversible lifts of reversible diffusions

**Francis Lörler** *Institute for Applied Mathematics, University of Bonn*

We propose a new concept of lifts of reversible diffusion processes and show that various non-reversible Markov processes arising in applications, including many piecewise-deterministic Markov processes introduced in the sampling literature, are lifts in this sense of simple reversible diffusions. We show that the relaxation time can at most be reduced by a square root through lifting, generalising a related result in discrete time. Finally, we demonstrate how the recently developed approach to quantitative hypocoercivity based on space-time Poincaré inequalities can be rephrased and simplified in the language of lifts and how it can be applied to find optimal lifts.
